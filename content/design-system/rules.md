Use the correct component.

Only hero sections at top of pages. Establish visual hierarchy.

Only one backpage section per backpage.

No backpage section on landing pages.

Landing pages must use hero instead of header.

Leads should not contain links (but can have formatting like bold and color) -- configure markdown editor for this. Links should be CTAs (list or button(s))

Don't use something just because you can.
