## Purpose

The home page serves several goals, from making a visual impact to welcoming newcomers and showcasing the latest news and events. We achieve these goals through a stack of components, each with their own options for interactivity and dynamic content.

### Required Sections

1. The **Hero block** fills the viewport with imagery and is meant to highlight a topical news story, academic program, initiative, profile. Should include a main call to action or button group or link list of your most important user actions. There are also variations that include a search, a featured YouTube video, or a form.

### Optional Sections

1. The Quicklinks block (optional) provides audience-specific navigation link alongside a relevant fact or editorial story
1. The Profile block (optional)
1. The Announcement block (optional) provides an additional space to display a single, timely news item
1. The News block uses the same component as the News page to showcase news stories, events, and newsletter signup forms.

Can be combined using column component.
