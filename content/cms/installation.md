Test summary.

## Bookshop Site

Uses Bookshop.

## Basic Hugo Site

How to deploy?

## CloudCannon Site

Testing locally.

Need a copy of other themes locally to mount them.

## Using the WVU Design System 3 Hugo Theme

There are multiple ways to import the WVU Design System 3 theme, depending on what you want to do.

Are you just using Hugo by itself, or with Cloudcannon?

Install submodule. Run the command. Drawback is if you want an updated version, you need to delete your local copy of the theme and reinstall the latest version.

Can install module. You have to add module to your config. But you can run a simple command to get updates.

However, Cloudcannon... site mounting. Already include?
