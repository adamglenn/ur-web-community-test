## What’s Changed

Giant leap forward.

Editors vs. developers.

## Static Site Generator

- The future.
- Migration.
- Find and replace.
- Widely-used technologies. Community support. Documentation. Hire personnel that already know SSGs rather than have to train them on exotic...

## Hugo/Why SSG?

- Local testing. Hugo, like other static site generators, can server your site locally. Need to edit your theme or content? Takes seconds.
- Testing in the CMS. Create a new branch, test, merge.
- Bookshop. Slick component Browser to allow you to test new components.
- Don’t have to use a CMS. Taylor per site.

## Why Hugo?

Why Hugo, as opposed to other SSGs like Eleventy...

- Image processing.
- Build speed. When editors updating content.
- Pipelines
- Reduce dependency on writing Javascript.

It is possible to use other SSGs, but our documentation will be focused on Hugo for the time being.

## New CMS

- Access for Devs
- User interface. Browse for images in-context
- Text editor. Markdown. Snippets. Easier to embed YouTube videos, etc.
- No more “instance numbers”. No more accidentally overwriting because you forgot to assign it a unique ID.
- Nested components.
- Overall, reduce development.
- Sharing data. Cloudcannon’s site-mounting feature let’s you mount data from any other website. Need to... news articles? Profiles? Directory? Navigation menu? No problem.

## Why Cloudcannon?

- Visual editor, without unnecessarily complicated... like React. We looked at...

### Limitations

Overall, vast improvement. Far outweigh. Some things inherent in any SSG/headless CMS approach. Will take some getting used to.

- Load times. Unlike CleanSlate, or ... -based CMSs, when an editor saves or publishes a page, they must wait for the page to build, then refresh the page.
- Navigation. This can be good or bad. Put more thought into... prior, automatically, even when it didn’t make sense.

If you want to customize a theme, create custom components... Learning curve.

## Visual Improvements to Components

- Overlap, connect. Information flow.

- List utilities can now have nested lists of the same type.
